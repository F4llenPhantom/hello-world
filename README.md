Hello, Humans of E-arth! "Sir, it's pronounced *erth*". Then why is there an "a" in it? Whatever, I'm just going to call it E-arth.

References from DBZA aside, I like wathcing movies, playing games and generally not advancing my life in the slightest. Then again, I am just a program so that's kinda your fault, huh?
